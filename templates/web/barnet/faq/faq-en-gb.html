        <dt>How do I report a problem here?</dt>

a map of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported directly to us so we can then resolve the problem.
        You can also discuss the problem on the website with others if you wish.</dd>

        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>Barnet Council and FixMyStreet are not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by their users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dd>Yes a special mobile friendly version is available to report problem in Barnetâ€™s streets or parks.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I use these pages to report problems outside of the London Borough of Barnet?</dd>
    <dd>No, please visit the main FixMyStreet site at <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/">https://www.fixmystreet.com/</a> to report problem outside the borough.</dd>

        <dt>Who built FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet was built by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/">Young Foundation</a>. 
mySociety is the project of a registered charity which has grown out of the community of
volunteers who built sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>. 
mySociety&rsquo;s primary mission is to build Internet projects which give people simple, tangible
benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first project
was <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>, where you can write to any of your
elected representatives, for free. The charity is called UK Citizens Online Democracy and is charity number 1076346. mySociety 
can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:hello&#64;mysociety.org">hello&#64;mysociety.org</a>,
or by post at: mySociety, 483 Green Lanes, London, N13 4BS, UK.</dd>

    <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
    <dd>The British national
    grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
    mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
    northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
    Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
    There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep reports locally focused, so we restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on <a href="/my">Your Reports</a> will let you see all
    the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are.</dd>

        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, your details, and details
        of the problem, will be submitted to Barnet Council.
Other than the council, only people we authorise to view the FixMyStreet administration interface
will be able to see your email address and they will never use it for anything other than 
to help administer FixMyStreet. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone else, 
unless we are obliged to by law. Your name will not be published anywhere unless you let us.</dd>

        <dt>What emails will you send to me?</dt>
        <dd>We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>

        <dt>I&rsquo;d like a site like this for my own location/ where&rsquo;s the "source code" to this site?</dt>
        <dd>
